# TodoMVC Diode React Example

The familiar TodoMVC application implemented in Diode React. Adapted from 
[TodoMVC Scala.js React](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/scalajs-react).

See [live demonstration](http://ochrons.github.io/diode/examples/todomvc/)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository from GitHub
1. Run `sbt "~fastOptJS"` in the `examples/todomvc` directory
1. Wait for update/compilation to complete (you'll see `1. Waiting for source changes... (press enter to interrupt)`)
1. Navigate to [http://localhost:12345/target/scala-2.11/classes/index.html](http://localhost:12345/target/scala-2.11/classes/index.html)
1. Press `Enter` in console to quit


Note: the Diode library needs to be installed locally with `package`, `publishLocal`, otherwise you might get `unresolved dependency` error
